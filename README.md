# Call-Center-Trends-Analysis-using-Python

**Introduction**
This project aims to analyze call center data using Python and its data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The data set used in this project contains call center metrics. 

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to identify trends in call center performance over time, analyze factors that contribute to high or low performance, and generate insights to help call center managers make data-driven decisions to improve their operations.

**steps**

The project will involve the following steps:


**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** : The raw data will be cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing irrelevant data.

**Data Visualization** : Various charts and graphs will be created using Matplotlib to help visualize the call center data and identify trends and patterns.

**Data Analysis** : Using Pandas and NumPy, various statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression analysis will be used to identify the factors that contribute to high or low performance in the call center.

**Reporting and Presentation** : The project will conclude with a report summarizing the insights and findings from the analysis, and recommendations for call center managers to improve their operations.
